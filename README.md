Grouped Timer Management App

The original requirement was to build this project as a React Native mobile application. However, as a Full-Stack Developer with strong experience in ReactJS and Node.js, I chose to implement this using ReactJS for the web to:

1.Rapidly prototype and demonstrate all requested features.

2.Ensure easy accessibility and testing without requiring a mobile environment.

3.Showcase clean UI/UX design principles and grouped timer logic within a browser-based setup.

This web-based version fully supports the core requirements — timer customization, category grouping, progress visualization, halfway alerts, and minimal third-party dependencies — and is structured to be portable to a React Native app in future development phases.

Features

-  Create multiple timers with name, duration, and category.
-  View timers grouped by category.
-  Filter timers by category.
-  Toggle between Light and Dark mode.
-  Halfway alert support (optional).
-  Local storage persistence.
-  Timer history page.
